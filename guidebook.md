# Enhancing Business Logic with Advanced Javascript Functionality

## Goal
This session seeks to expose some of the built-in functionality of the Javascript language that can be used to enhance the functionality of ServiceNow scripts to compliment the robust set of libraries provided by ServiceNow.

### Working with Types
Javascript provides a number of functions to allow to you identify types of data and work with those data types specifically.  We will discuss the following functions/operators that facilitate the manipulation of typed data:
  * toString
  * parseInt
  * parseFloat
  * toString
  
### String Processing with Regular Expressions
One of the most powerful tools for string manipulation is Regular Expressions.  Although intimidating when they are broken down they are very easy to understand and can be used for almost any string manipulation task.

### Array Manipulation
Since arrays are a basic data structure in Javascript it is helpful to be able to manipulate the data contained within along with the array structure itself.  The following functions will allow just this:

  * indexOf
  * slice
  * splice
  * push
  * pop
  * join
  * forEach
  * map
  * filter
  
  
### Callback Functions
While there are built-in examples that use callback functions (such as forEach, map, and filter) callback functionality can be used in the development of custom functions.  We will discuss the creation and usage of custom callback functions.

### Closures
A closure in Javascript has the ability to keep data and program logic separate from main program logic.  This can provide simplicity for future developers and security for the overall application.

### Object Oriented Programming
Can an object be created in Javascript?  We will show the creation of these advanced structures that deliver robust object oriented functionality.

### Polyfills
Changed in Javascript from version to version can lead to complications in the development process with functionality either being depricated or not yet released.  Polyfills allow for the implementation of functionality to bridge the gabs between versions.
